## WHAT I LEARNED
- Implement data visualization techniques and plots using Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to tell a stimulating story
- Create different types of charts and plots such as line, area, histograms, bar, pie, box, scatter, and bubble
- Create advanced visualizations such as waffle charts, word clouds, regression plots, maps with markers, & choropleth maps
- Generate interactive dashboards containing scatter, line, bar, bubble, pie, and sunburst charts using the Dash framework and Plotly library
